# AmeriFlux Measurement Height Data Processing

This repository provides tools for downloading, processing, and analyzing AmeriFlux Measurement Height data. The dataset contains height/depth and instrument model information for AmeriFlux BASE data products.

## About the Dataset
Measurement Height is a temporary data product being offered while the AmeriFlux BADM infrastructure is upgraded. The downloaded CSV file contains information provided directly by site teams or from historical records.

### Data Fields:
| Field Name          | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Site_ID            | Site identifier. |
| Variable           | Name of the variable in the BASE file. |
| Start_Date         | Date when the information first applies. No value means it applies from the start of the siteâ€™s full data record. |
| Height            | Distance from the ground in meters. Positive values are heights; negative values are depths. |
| Instrument_Model   | Instrument model used to collect the data variable. |
| Instrument_Model2  | A second instrument model, used for flux variables. |
| Comment           | Additional information provided by site teams. |
| BASE_Version      | The most recent AmeriFlux BASE data product version number for which the information applies. |
